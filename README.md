# CRUD Application using Node.js, MySQL, and React

## Project Description
A CRUD application utilizing Node.js for the server-side, MySQL as the database, and React for the user interface. It allows users to perform basic CRUD operations (Create, Read, Update, Delete) for student records.

## Features
- Add a new student with their details.
- Display a list of all registered students.
- Update the current student's data.
- Delete students from the records.

## Technologies Used
- **Node.js:** Used for developing the server-side to handle requests and responses.
- **MySQL:** Used to store and manage student data.
- **React:** Used for designing a dynamic and interactive user interface.

## How to Run the Application
1. Install dependencies using the command `npm install` in both the `server` and `client` folders.
2. Configure the MySQL database using the script found in the `script.sql` file.
3. Run the server using the command `npm start` in the `server` folder.
4. Run the user interface using the command `npm start` in the `client` folder.

## System Requirements
- Node.js (preferably using the LTS version)
- MySQL Server
- Modern web browser (preferably Google Chrome)

## Future Improvements
- Add an authentication system for enhanced security.
- Improve and redesign the user interface.
- Implement search and sorting capabilities in the list.
